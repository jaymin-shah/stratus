##### Router

More soon.

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```

##### Plugins

Plugins are simple objects that provide Design functionality to DOM elements, independent of a model or collection, which effectively removes all API support.

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```

##### Widgets

Widgets are complex objects that provide API and Design functionality to DOM elements, which include a model or collection for API support.

```js
// These examples will be expanded
if (tbd) console.log('tbd');
```
